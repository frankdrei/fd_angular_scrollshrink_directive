# fd_angular_scrollshrink_directive
A simple "ScrollShrink" Directive for any given Html Container

As You can see in Index.html:

use the scrollshrink Directive in any HTML tag with parameter that divides the ammount of real
scrolling. So you can have diffrent speed of scrolling.

In future i will use this for typo3 or angular-material
